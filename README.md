# llmpeg

Let's be honest, who really knows how to use `ffmpeg`. Its that tool that is so helpful but not needed enough to justify learning all of its inner workings. The days of scrolling through stackoverflow are over, with `llmpeg`. This CLI tool interfaces with an OpenAI LLM (and has support for other LLM API providers) to convert your plain text commands into OS/platform specific ffmpeg commands. 

`llmpeg` is a powerful wrapper around the popular multimedia library `ffmpeg`, designed to simplify video and audio processing for users who are not familiar with the intricacies of `ffmpeg` commands. By leveraging language model technology, `llmpeg` allows users to describe their multimedia processing tasks in natural language, and the tool generates and executes the appropriate `ffmpeg` commands automatically.
